# ESHOP
Let's setup our python backend.
    ```    
    > cd backend
    ```
First you need to create your python virtual environment:
    ```
    > python3 -m venv venv
    ```
You can use any virtual environment, but here I use venv.
Activate virtual environment:
    ```
    > source venv/bin/activate
    ```
Then you need to install requierments for our shop:
    ```
    > pip install -r requierements.txt
    ```
Now you can run django server
    ```
    > python3 manage.py runserver
    ```
#Frontend
    ```
    > cd ../frontend
    ```
Install dependences:
    ```
    > npm install
    ```
Run frontend server:
    ```
    > npm start
    ```
Now if you go in your browser on http://localhost:3000 you would see the site's main page.
